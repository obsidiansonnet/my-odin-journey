- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Boilerplate.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** The essential, five-part structure of every HTML5 document: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
- **Aha! Moment:** The key realization was the clear separation between the `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` is for invisible metadata (data *about* the page, like the title for the browser tab), while the `<body>` is the container for all the visible content the user actually sees.
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Begin the "Working with Text" lesson.
