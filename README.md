**August 4, 2025**
- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - Commit Messages.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** Learned the two-part structure of a professional commit message (subject and body) and the conventions for writing them.
- **Aha! Moment:** The realisation that it is advisable to write the commit messages in imperative mood to maintain consistency with the grammar of the automated commit messages, making the commit history consistent and easy to understand and read.        
- **Coming Days' Goal:** Revise everything before attempting the project.


**August 3, 2025**
- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - Links and Images.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** Meaning and use of tags used to link webpages and display images and various attributes and their values used with these tags to influence how images are displayed and ensure security and privacy when linked pages are programmed to open in separate tabs or windows - '<a>', '<img>', 'href', 'target', 'noopener', 'noreferrer', 'src', and 'width'. Four types of image formats - JPG, SVG, GIF, and PNG - and their ideal use cases.
- **Aha! Moment:** Realisation that certain features that were deemed necessary for a certain type of websites a few years ago came with security risks, and ironically, the steps taken to avert the security risks break the feature's functionality: Attribute and value pair 'target=_blank' opens the linked page in a new tab, allowing the linked page to maintain communication with the original page, a feature used to present login pages, historically, but applying the security measures - 'noreferrer and noopener' - severs this connection and by extension, its utility in presenting login pages.        
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Begin with "Commit Messages".


**August 2, 2025**
- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - Lists.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** Meaning and use of tags used to create lists - '<ul>', '<li>', and '<ol>'. 
- **Aha! Moment:** The realizations, through experimenting, that tags '<ul>' and '<ol>' influence whether the list items would be displayed as bullet points or numbered points; and that removing the '<ul>' and '<ol>' tags but retaining the list items wrapped in their respective'<li>' tags presents the list items as bullet points and removes the indentation. '<ul>' and '<ol>' are both semantic and block elements.     
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Begin with "Links and Images".


**August 1, 2025**
- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - Working with Text.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** Meaning and use of HTML Tags - Paragraphs, headings, strong, and emphasis; How to create and use comments; relationship between nested elements. 
- **Aha! Moment:** The realization that the tags paragraph, headings, strong, and emphasis are semantic. They provide meaning to the content they wrap, influencing how assistive technologies present them and how search engines index them. The visual effects are all browser's doing.    
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Begin the "Lists" lesson.


**July 31, 2025**
- **Today's Focus:** The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Boilerplate.
- **Key Concepts Learned:** The essential, five-part structure of every HTML5 document: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
- **Aha! Moment:** The key realization was the clear separation between the `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` is for invisible metadata (data *about* the page, like the title for the browser tab), while the `<body>` is the container for all the visible content the user actually sees.
- **Tomorrow's Goal:** Begin the "Working with Text" lesson.
